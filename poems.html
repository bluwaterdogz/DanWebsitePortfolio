		<h2 class="show">Eye of the Storm</h2>
		<div class="poemtext">
			<br>
			<br>
			Here we sit in the eye of the storm <br>
			Sit closer to me and I can keep you warm <br>
			Don’t stray too far or I might not see you again <br>
			Please stay grounded so we don’t get swept up in the wind <br>
			If you get swept up I will lend you my hand <br>
			If you reach back to me you will gently land <br>
			When the wall of the storm creeps up to our sides  <br>
			Get ahold of me and we can both catch our eyes <br>
			Lightning might strike but it shouldn't have to strike twice <br>
			Far off in the distance it might even look nice <br>
			The voice of the thunder takes time to hear  <br>
			The time it takes tells us if lightning is near <br>
			Thunder itself is nothing to fear <br>
			But keep your eyes open along with your ear <br>
			A crack in the sky might cause a huge scene <br>
			Hold each other close and the crack won't come between <br>
			If rain should fall even through the center of our eye <br>
			I will see you through it until it becomes dry. <br>

		<h2 class="show">Mr.Kitty(Dedicated to Toby)</h2>
		<div class="poemtext">
			<br>
			<br>
			Poor Mr.Kitty He needs his medicine <br>
			Left his home loaded on catnip and amphetamines <br>
			Chased some rats to the levy downtown <br>
			Cat catcher caught up and through him in the pound <br>
			Skinny Mr.Kitty with a good head on his shoulders <br>
			Gathered a group of fat cats all tough as boulders <br>
			The crew of cats creeped through the yard <br>
			hustling ketamine to the old saint bernards <br>
			Space ran scarce in the animal prison <br>
			Soon it came time for lethal injection <br>
			The time to escape was now or never <br>
			Mr.Kitty assembled his crew for this risky endeavour <br>
			Breaching the gates with the reapers at bay  <br>
			Would take place when night turned today <br>
			Mr.Kitty arched his back and crouched to the ground  <br>
			The crew of cats escaped without making a sound <br>
			Back on the streets the kitties got wise <br>
			Figured making the best with the rest of their nine lives <br>

			She stepped to the right  <br>
			As I got left <br>
			I ran to her side  <br>
			But lost my breath <br>
			She followed me  <br>
			But I’m always lost <br>
			Ill find her the right place <br>
			No matter what the cost <br>
			I stepped to the right  <br>
			And fell off the edge  <br>
			She grabbed my hand tight  <br>
			And pulled me back on the ledge <br>
			We stepped together <br> 
			And found the right path  <br>
			Ill lose her never <br>
			Cause I always hear her laugh <br>

		<h2 class="show">Spliffneck</h2>
		<div class="poemtext">
			<br>
			<br>
			stiff neck spliff throat soar toke <br>
			confessed love through a joke <br>
			the words which wernt spoke <br>
			were the words on which I choke <br>
			her hazey low desire <br>
			makes my mind easily tired <br>
			the security is admired <br>
			but my words still arnt fired <br>
			the crush in a gist <br>
			was a hit and a miss <br>
			she left and im pissed <br>
			spliffs kiss the diss <br>
			palm unrolls from a fist <br>
			from there it begins <br>
			thoughts of the seven deadly sins <br>
			they enter the brain
			projecting blame <br>
			from embarrassing fame <br>
			naming names <br>
			making minds play games <br>
			but it is clutch <br>
			not to think so much <br>
			switch thought to touch <br>
			keep your life drive  <br>
			eyes on the prize  <br>
			because no one ever leaves life alive  <br>
			<br>

		<h2 class="show">No Name</h2>

			<br>
			<br>
			he made no cents as he begged on the street <br>
			his mind is ravaged and his body is beat <br>
			hes lost everything even toes from his feet <br>
			smells like piss shit and forgotten old meat <br>
			every time he comes so close to death <br>
			but always ends up in the spot he just left <br>
			hates the taste of food water and even his own breathe <br>
			his moms name was pearl and his daddy was jeff <br>
			he bleeds blood like the rest of the human race <br>
			he bleeds blood when he pulls the scabs from his face <br>
			life is hard for the irreversibly insane <br>
			theres light at the end of the tunnel but for him its a train <br>
			<br>

		<h2 class="show">Slow Thlomsies</h2>
		<div class="poemtext">
			<br>
			<br>
			Slow thlomsies slide smoothly through soft moist marmalade  <br>
			While wimpy wogles waft wearily where the duck <br>
			And tiny tipsies drift daringly down a new way   <br>
			The critters cast patterns on a busy day <br>
			Including the insects incubuds trees  and their sway <br>
			Cheeky children chant and laugh as they watch and play <br>
			confused the adults rely on a child's hearsay <br>
			fore they are blind to the critters in the bay <br>
			the more blind the less mind <br>
			the wonder fades away <br>
			<br>

		<h2 class="show">Travellers</h2>
		<div class="poemtext">
			<br>
			<br>
			to me  <br>
			as they travel they keep their heads down <br>
			their footsteps decay the earth and its ground <br>
			their eyes still ring with the things that theyve seen <br>
			the beast and the machine <br>
			as they walk from heaven to hell <br>
			they drag along souls who dwell <br>
			in hatred and spite <br>
			the rats of the night <br>
			those who see no light <br>
			as they walk they keep their heads down <br>
			they walk along side without making a sound <br>
			if they walk with you you wont be found <br>
			<br>

		<h2 class="show">A Tale of Caution</h2>
		<div class="poemtext">
			<br>
			<br>
			I got anger <br>
			and its poison to my body <br>
			it puts blisters on my skin <br>
			I got hatred and its killin me slowly <br>
			its growing from deep within <br>
			I got rage <br>
			with every day it grows stronger <br>
			Im feelin like I might give in <br>
			I push and shove <br>
			cause I cant get no love <br>
			but Im fightin myself  <br>
			and fightin doesnt help <br>
			cause in the end <br>
			it starts all over again <br>

		<h2 class="show">No Eyes</h2>
		<div class="poemtext">
			<br>
			<br>
			Have you met the man with no eyes <br>
			he searches in circles for directions and guides <br>
			he asks for help from the people passing by  <br>
			they cant really help and they rarely reply <br>
			but when they respond they reply with a lie <br>
			Have you met the woman who needs a ride <br>
			she went down south and always cried <br>
			she keeps going even when the south has dried <br>
			I couldnt keep up but I still tried <br>
			she stole my car and left me on the side <br>
			Have you met the boy who never existed  <br>
			his world is weird not sick just twisted <br>
			he needs nothing in life but likes having kisses <br>
			he was never born but to the world he was gifted <br>
			he loves all thats alive and nothing thats dead <br>
			he imagined a girl all in his head <br>
			he created my world as he slept in her bed <br>
			<br>

		<h2 class="show">Cigarettes</h2>
		<div class="poemtext">
			<br>
			<br>
			Hands holding grits <br>
			lit spit <br>
			holding hits  <br>
			flick the bits <br>
			bick the tips  <br>
			fits to get <br>
			embers to burn <br>
			ash a turn <br>
			mourne the ern  <br>
			where carbon churns <br>
